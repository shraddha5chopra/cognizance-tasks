**a. Why must we choose you?**

We all know computer science has become a boom for technological development in every field. I am a self motivated person and I try to exceed my superiorâ€™s expectations with high-quality work. I work well both as an individual contributor and also as a team member.
I'm well versed with C,C++ and SQL. I'm learning Python now.
I believe this club will surely prove to be an excellent platform for me to establish my skills and knowledge in the field of computer science.
Even though I have just passed the first semester, I assure you that I will give my best and work to my full potential so that I can contribute as much as I can towards the growth and welfare of this club.

**b. What is your plan for the next 6 months?**

First and foremost I aim to keep a good academic record. So I'll work extremely hard to achieve good grades in each subject. Apart from that, I need to complete understanding
JAVA and Python thoroughly. I had participated in a CTF in my first semester and quite enjoyed it. I aim to solve more and more complex problems of previous CTFs. I also plan to register for Generation Google Scholarship and Google Summer of Code in my next semester. (and any other competitions I come across)

**c. How would you contribute back to the club?**
