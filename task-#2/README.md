**2. Debugging Derbies**
**A Quiz Application for Maths using Java.**

I ran the code on an online Java complier which gave me the initial errors and their respective lines.
The initial errors were unnecessary commented lines, semi-colons and brackets missing, changing from lowercase to uppercase etc.
