### **2. Debugging Derbies**
#### **A Quiz Application for Maths using Java.**

I ran the code on an online Java complier which gave me the initial errors and their respective lines.
The initial errors were unnecessary commented lines, semi-colons and brackets missing, changing from lowercase to uppercase etc. 

After removing these errors, I ran the code on my Visual Source Code to check for the logical errors and removed them. 
I realized that the 'Start' and 'Stop' had to be replaced after successfully running it for the first time.

Also, the name had to be changed from "MathQuiz" to "MathsQuiz" as per the given question. 

Similarly, I was able to successfully remove all the errors after running the code multiple times.
